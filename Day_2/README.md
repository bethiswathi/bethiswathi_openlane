# Chip Floor Plan Considerations

Floorplanning is the initial physical design step where the overall structure and layout of a chip are defined. It determines how effectively the design can be placed and routed later. The key tasks involved are:

Ex:- Consider a netlist with 2 Flip-Flops with an And gate and a OR gate. </br>

Assume the dimensions of standard cells and flip-flops as 1 unit ie. the area is 1 sq.unit. If we club all of them we can findout the rough calculation of  width and height</br>

If we realize all the cells on the core area, we can observe it is occupying complete core area.</br>

### 1. Die and Core Definition
- The die area and core area are set based on design size and routing needs.
- This establishes the physical boundary within which all logic will be placed.

### 2. Aspect Ratio
- Defines the shape of the core using the ratio:
- Aspect Ratio = Core Height / Core Width
- Aspect ratio 1 → square, otherwise rectangular.
- Impacts routing congestion and timing.
- The aspect ratio for the above example is 1

### 3. Utilization Factor
- Indicates how much of the core area is used by standard cells.
- Defined as:
Utilization = (Area of netlist) / (Core area)
- Typically kept between 0.5 to 0.7 to leave whitespace for routing.
- The Utilization factor for above example is 100%

### 4. Preplaced Cells (Macros)
- Large blocks (e.g., memories, comparators, clock gating cells) with fixed locations.
- These IP's/blocks have user-defined locations and hence they are placed before automated placement and routing.
- They are placed before standard cells and influence overall routing and congestion.
- May be used multiple times in the design.

### 5. Decoupling Capacitors (Decaps)
- Placed near macros or high-switching regions.
- Help reduce voltage drop, maintain noise margin, and provide local charge during fast switching.
- Act as local power reservoirs.

### 6. Power Planning (PDN)
- Creation of power distribution networks (VDD and GND rails, straps, rings).
- Ensures uniform power delivery and mitigates IR drop and ground bounce.
- In OpenLANE, PDN is usually done before routing.

### 7. Pin Placement
- Input/output pins are assigned around the core periphery.
- Cell placement blockages are added to avoid routing congestion near boundaries.

### 8. Final Floorplanning
- Combines all the above: macro placement, I/O pins, power grid, aspect ratio, utilization.
- Ensures the design is ready for placement and routing.

Floorplanning phase generates DEF file which contains core area and placement details of standard cells.

| **Step**     | **Function**               | **Description**                                                                                         |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **init_fp**  | Initialize Floorplan       | Defines the **core area**, creates **placement rows**, and generates **routing tracks** for the design. |
| **ioplacer** | I/O Pin Placement          | Automatically places the **macro input/output pins** around the core boundary.                          |
| **pdn**      | Power Distribution Network | Generates the **power grid** (VDD/GND rings, straps, rails) for proper power delivery across the chip.  |
| **tapcell**  | Tapcell & Decap Insertion  | Inserts **well-tap cells** for substrate/well biasing and **decap cells** to reduce IR drop and noise.  |

### Placement
- Placement defines the locations of standard cells or logic elements within each block. Some circuit elements may have fixed locations while others are movable.
- DEF file generated by placement phase can be utilized by magic tool to get the floorplan view which requires 3 configuration files:
   - Magic Technology file (sky130A.tech)
   - DEF file from floorplan phase
   - Merged LEF from preparation phase

## Netlist Binding and initial place design
- Netlist binding refers to the process of mapping the logical elements in the synthesized netlist to the physical cells in the physical design (PD) environment.
- In physical design tools (like OpenROAD/OpenLANE, Innovus, ICC2), the flow needs to bind or associate:
- Each logical cell instance → to a specific physical cell from the standard cell library
- Each logical port/net → to its physical pin information from the LEF/lib files

## ✅ Why Netlist Binding Is Important
### 1. Ensures correct mapping
- Links each logical gate (NAND, INV, DFF, etc.) to a physical layout view.

### 2. Enables physical placement
- Without binding, the tool cannot create placement rows, locations, or routing resources.

### 3. Validates library compatibility
- Checks if the design uses only available cells from the target technology.

### 4. Creates internal data structures
- The tool builds timing graphs, placement objects, and routing anchors.

## ✅ What Happens During Netlist Binding  
| Process        | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Read netlist   | Parse Verilog or synthesized gate-level netlist                     |
| Read libraries | Load `.lib` for timing and `.lef` for physical geometry             |
| Match cells    | Bind each netlist cell instance to its standard-cell master         |
| Resolve pins   | Connect logical nets to physical pin locations                      |
| Check legality | Verify no missing cells, mismatched pins, or unsupported constructs |

## Standard Cell Design Flow and Library Requirements 
- In all RTL-to-GDSII flows, EDA tools depend on **standard-cell libraries** that contain logic gates (AND, OR, buffers), macros, IPs, decaps, and different variants of each cell (different sizes, threshold voltages, and drive strengths).
- Larger cells offer higher drive strength but occupy more area and may switch slower depending on threshold voltage.

## ✅ Inputs Required to Design a Single Library Cell
A standard cell is created using foundry-provided PDK (Process Design Kit) data plus user specifications:

1. PDK Files
- **DRC & LVS Rules**: Technology files, layer rules, poly/substrate parameters → ensure layout correctness.
- **SPICE Models**: Foundry MOSFET electrical models (threshold voltage, mobility, saturation behavior), NMOS/PMOS parameters → used for circuit simulations.

2. User-Specified Requirements
- **Cell height** (fixed by power/ground rail spacing)
- **Cell width** (depends on transistor sizing/drive strength)
- **Supply voltage (VDD)**
- **Metal layer requirements** for pin connections

These constraints ensure the cell works reliably when integrated into a chip.

## ✅ Library Cell Design Steps
1. Circuit Design
- Create the logic function using PMOS/NMOS transistors.
- Produce a **CDL (Circuit Description Language)** netlist.

2. Transistor Sizing
- Size NMOS and PMOS devices to meet delay, power, and drive-strength targets based on SPICE models.

3. Layout Design
- Use **Euler’s path** and **stick diagrams** to determine optimal transistor arrangement.
- Draw layout using tools like **Magic**.
- Must follow all DRC and LVS rules.

4. Outputs of Layout
- **GDSII file** → actual mask layout
- **LEF file** → abstract view (cell width/height, pins, blockages)
- **Extracted SPICE netlist (.cir)** → includes parasitic R, C for accurate simulation


## ✅ Cell Characterization
After layout, the cell is characterized (e.g., using **GUNA** or similar software):
- **Timing** (rise/fall delays, setup/hold times)
- **Noise** characteristics
- **Power** (dynamic, leakage)

These results are used to generate:
- .lib timing libraries
- .db binary timing libraries

These become essential inputs for synthesis, P&R, STA, and any RTL-to-GDSII tool
